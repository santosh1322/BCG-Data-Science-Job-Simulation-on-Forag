## Task 1 - Unveiling Customer Insights

### The Scenario
PowerCo, a major energy utility, faces significant churn, particularly among SME customers, due to market liberalization. BCG is on board to pinpoint the reasons behind SME churn, hypothesizing that price changes play a pivotal role. The SME division contemplates a 20% discount to retain at-risk customers.

### Your Mission
Dive deep into the hypothesis that churn is driven by price sensitivities. Craft an email to your Associate Director (AD) outlining your approach, data needs, and the analytical models to test the hypothesis.

#### Key Considerations:
- Identify key factors influencing customer decisions to stay or switch providers.
- Envision an ideal data frame structure for analysis.
- Propose exploratory analyses to glean insights into customer churn behavior.

## Task 2 - Data-Driven Revelations

### The Exploration
Armed with historical customer and pricing data, it's time to explore, validate, and enrich insights.

**Sub-Task 1: Exploration**
- Delve into data types, statistics, and variable distributions.
- Gain a holistic understanding of the dataset.

**Sub-Task 2: Price Sensitivity Validation**
- Define and calculate price sensitivity.
- Verify if price sensitivity correlates with churn.

**Sub-Task 3: Key Findings & Suggestions**
- Summarize key discoveries in a half-page.
- Recommend data augmentation sources and open datasets for a comprehensive analysis.

#### Resources
Utilize the provided datasets and links for data visualization.

## Task 3 - Predictive Power Unleashed

### Unveiling Churn Predictors
Empower the team's understanding by crafting features and modeling churn probability.

**Sub-Task 1: Feature Engineering**
- Build on the colleague's feature: "Difference between off-peak prices in December and January of the preceding year."
- Creatively engineer additional features for deeper insights.

**Sub-Task 2: Model Evaluation**
- Train a Random Forest classifier.
- Assess model performance with justified metrics.
- Document Random Forest pros and cons for this use case.

**Bonus: Financial Impact Assessment**
- Relate model performance to potential client savings with the proposed 20% discount.
- Outline assumptions and considerations for the financial impact.

## Task 4 - Strategic Synthesis

### Project Progress Abstract
The client seeks a quick update. Craft an abstract slide for the stakeholder meeting, focusing on crucial findings and recommendations.

- Identify the most impactful metric for the client.
- Articulate the potential bottom-line impact of the predictive model.
